# Website Code Saving Process

This repository contains instructions on how to save website code effectively. By following these steps, you can easily create a local repository and store your website code while also integrating it with Git for version control and collaboration.

## Step 1: Copying the Code
1. Open the code editor for your website.
2. Locate each page that contains code, preferably using the search function in the Wix Dev Mode.
3. Copy the code from each page and ensure that you capture all the necessary code snippets.

## Step 2: Creating a Local Repository
1. Name your local repository using the following scheme: "Firstname-Secondname-Thirdname". Separate each word with a hyphen ("-").
2. Create separate folders within your repository to segregate the files into backend and frontend components for every website.

## Step 3: Organizing the Files
1. Place the copied code files into the appropriate folders based on their functionality.
2. Store the frontend code files in the "frontend" folder, ensuring each file is properly named in camel case (camelCase) to maintain consistency and clarity.

## Step 4: Setting up Git Repository
1. Create a repository on Git with the same name as your local repository, following the naming scheme used earlier.
2. Initialize the Git repository on your local machine using the Git command "git init".
3. Add all the changes to the repository using the command "git add .".

## Step 5: Committing and Connecting
1. Make all the necessary commits to document the changes and progress of your website code. Use clear and concise commit messages.
2. Connect your local repository to the Git repository you created earlier by following the directions provided on the Git new repository page.

## Step 6: Pushing to the Online Repository
1. Finally, push the code from your local repository to the newly created Git repository online. Use the command "git push" to upload your code and make it accessible for collaboration.

By following these steps, you will have successfully saved your website code, organized it into frontend and backend components, and integrated it with Git for version control and collaboration.
